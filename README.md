# Calculator.java
This is my  first project with using git on comand line .
I created a class named Calculator.
I created constractor for it.
I created add,substract,multiply,divide,and module methods.
I wanted to control their outputs ,so I gave them parameter ,and I put retun all of them.
In main method I input integer values .
I tested ; there wasn't any bugs.
I opened terminal ,and I directed  files to here with using git codes.
